Ahmar Waseem  Lahore, Punjab  Ó   +923194236019   R   ahmarwsm@gmail.com   °   Ahmar Waseem      Ahmarws  PROFILE  I’m Ahmar Waseem, an IT professional who recently graduated with a BS-IT degree from Govt. College University, Faisalabad, and I’m currently awaiting my results. I have a solid foundation in both Front-end and Back-end development, with a focus on the MERN stack—MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. While I consider my skills in this area to be at a moderate level, I’m eager to deepen my knowledge, particularly in advanced concepts and best practices. In addition to my technical background, I served as an MIS Coordinator at Zam Zam Traders, where I managed financial operations and utilized various software tools. I’m a good learner and am committed to improving my skills. I also enjoy motivational speaking and have developed strong communication and problem-solving abilities, which help me work effectively in team settings.  EDUCATION GOVT.
